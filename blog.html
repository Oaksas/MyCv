    <p class="title"> Pros of using relative size( %, em, rem) over pixel.</p>
    <article>
<p>
    %, em and rem are relative measurement units of length used in webpages. As webpages could be run on different screen size platforms or devices, using the static and most precise measurement like pixel( px) would not be so convenient
</p>
<p>  Using pixels as a measurement unit in webpages, most of the time, limits users from experiencing the most from the website they want to surf. They have to use the same screen-size device as the developer in order to see all the same output as the developer. Moreover partially-visually-impaired users could not increase, let’s say, the font size of the page he/she would like to access. This would cause a bias of information among users.  The layout is also one problem: as the user with smaller or larger screen-size device might find the webpage layout changing as screen-size changes. The convenient ways to use pixel are: when we want build a website which could be used in a small team on the same screen-sized device, and when we want to preserve some constant spacing among the webpage elements.</p>
   
<p>-	Em – these measurement is taken as a reference to its container. For example, 1 em of a paragraph in div tag is determined by in-proportion to the font size of its parent div. </p>

<p>-	Rem – these measurement is taken as a reference to the root element which is the HTML itself. Usually most browsers use the HTML size of 16px so 1Rem = 16px.</p>
